## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.



## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  set_inverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  get_inverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
  set_inverse = set_inverse,
  get_inverse = get_inverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the set_inverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$get_inverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$set_inverse(i)
  i   
}
